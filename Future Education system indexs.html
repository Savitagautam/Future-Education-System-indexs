            <p class="sectinSubTag text-small">Education designed to support early development in preparation for
                participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of three.
                This is ISCED level 01.[21] Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven,
                depending on the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with
                their peers and the educator.[21] These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in
                the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.[23] Kindergarten
                "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at
                unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of
                them."[24] This is ISCED level 02.[21]</p>

            <p class="sectinSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectinSubTag text-small">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and
                intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes
                Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The
                European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences
                spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other
                civilizations as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of
                knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's
                Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences./p>
